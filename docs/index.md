# IMS Cloud Provider

The provider is used to interact with the resources provided by [IMS Cloud](https://cloud.ims-network.net).

To create a server resource, it's recommended to use our 
[server configuration interface](https://config.cloud.ims-network.net) 
which provides ready to use Terraform templates with valid configuration options and identifiers according to your selection.
